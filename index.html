<p>Welcome! I am Aakash Saravanan. My drive to continuously learn has propelled me to pursue a Masters degree in 
        Computer Engineering with a concentration in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
        Currently, I am a Graduate Teaching Assistant for ECE 20001 (Electrical Engineering Fundamentals 1)
        course taught at Purdue. I hope to start full-time work this summer of 2022 to continue
        to hone in on my technical and soft skills!</p>
